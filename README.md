# BalfComment
<p>This is a very simple commenting system. The purpose of it is to generate the appropriate HTML and provide an object-oriented way to add and manage comments on a webpage using PHP. BalfComment is simple to use and not particularly complex. Its purpose is to be dropped in with minimal configuration. </p>
<p>
  The <code>autoGenerateComments</code> method is designed to be used with the <a href="https://github.com/jamiebalfour04/Girder-Framework">Girder Framework</a>, but you
  can modify the generation code as you wish.
</p>

<del>This is no longer used on my personal website.</del>. Since it was updated on the 11th of October 2025, BalfComment has been the primary commenting system on my website.
